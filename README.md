# Warp-Scheduler
A Verilog-based RTL implementation of a Round-Robin Warp Scheduler, simulating how modern GPUs select warps for execution. The design models 32 warp lanes using bitmasks and supports ready/stall status for realistic thread handling. Includes testbenches, waveform output, and Yosys synthesis support.
